# üöÄ Hackatime Doctor

A beginner-friendly diagnostic tool that helps you set up Hackatime for tracking your coding activity!

## ü§î What is this?

Hackatime Doctor is like a health checkup for your development environment. It checks if everything is properly installed and configured so you can start tracking your coding time with Hackatime (a self-hosted alternative to WakaTime).

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### First, set up the doctor tool:

1. **Download this project**
   ```bash
   # If you have git:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd hackatime-doc
   
   # Or download and extract the ZIP file, then:
   cd hackatime-doc
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Now you can run the doctor!**

### Option 1: Simple command
```bash
node doctor.mjs
```

### Option 2: Using npm scripts (even easier!)
```bash
npm run doctor
# or
npm run checkup
# or  
npm run help
```

## üìã What does it check?

The doctor will check these 8 important things:

1. **Git** - Version control system for your code
2. **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for your computer  
3. **package.json** - Your project configuration file
4. **Dependencies** - Required code libraries
5. **src/ folder** - Where your source code lives
6. **.env file** - Your API keys and settings
7. **README.md** - Documentation for your project
8. **API Connection** - Can we connect to your Hackatime server?

## üÜò First time using this?

Don't worry! Here's what to do:

1. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
   - On Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal"
   - On Windows: Press `Win + R`, type "cmd"
   - In VS Code: Press `Ctrl + \`` (backtick)

2. **Navigate to this project folder**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/hackatime-doc
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the doctor**
   ```bash
   node doctor.mjs
   ```

5. **Follow the suggestions!**
   - The tool will show you exactly what to fix
   - Copy and paste the suggested commands
   - Run the doctor again to see your progress

## üîß Common fixes

### "Git is not installed"
```bash
# Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads and install Git
# Or on Mac with Homebrew:
brew install git
```

### "Node.js is not installed"
```bash
# Visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS version
```

### "package.json not found"
```bash
npm init -y
```

### "Dependencies not installed"
```bash
npm install
```

### "src/ folder missing"
```bash
mkdir src
```

### ".env file missing"
Create a file called `.env` in your project root:
```env
HACKATIME_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
HACKATIME_API_URL=https://hackatime.hackclub.com/api/hackatime/v1
```

**Tip**: You can also copy the `.env.example` file and fill in your API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## üéØ What's next?

Once all checks pass:

1. Install the Hackatime extension in your code editor
2. Start coding and watch your stats grow!
3. Check your Hackatime dashboard to see your activity

## üîÑ Running again

You can run this tool as many times as you want! It's especially helpful to run it again after fixing issues to make sure everything is working.

## üö® Troubleshooting the Doctor Tool

### "node: command not found"
You need to install Node.js first:
- Visit https://nodejs.org/ and download the LTS version
- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

### "Cannot find module 'chalk'" or similar errors
You need to install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### "Permission denied" errors
On Mac/Linux, you might need to make the file executable:
```bash
chmod +x doctor.mjs
```

### Script runs but doesn't do anything
Make sure you're in the right folder:
```bash
# Check if you're in the hackatime-doc folder
ls
# You should see: doctor.mjs, package.json, README.md
```

Happy coding! üéâ
